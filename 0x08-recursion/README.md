===========> function that prints a string <==========
  # The _puts_recursion function is defined, which takes a character pointer s as input. A character pointer points to the beginning of a string.
  # Inside the function, we have a base case. We check if the current character (pointed by s) is the end of the string, which is represented by the    null terminator '\0'. If it is, we print a new line (\n) to start a new line in the output, and then we return from the function to stop further    recursion
  # If the current character is not the end of the string, we print the current character using putchar(*s). putchar is a function that prints a        single character to the standard output.where *s is the character being pointed by the pointer s.
  # After printing the current character, we call the _puts_recursion function again with the next character in the string. This is achieved by         passing s + 1 as the argument, which increments the pointer s to point to the next character in the string. This process continues recursively      until the base case is reached and the function starts returning.
