==========> a function that checks for uppercase character <==========
## must return 1 if it is uppercase and 0 otherwise
     *** problrm one --> how to check it ?
               @ using if and else
 
     *** problem two ---> to what to check it against ?
               @ if char alphabet is greater than "A" 
               @ and less than "Z" print 1 
               @ else print 0


==========> a function that checks for a digit <==========
## must rturn 1 if it is digit and 0 otherwise
     *** the same logic as the above 
               @if it digit print 1 else print 0



==========> a function that multiplies two integers <==========
## must multiply two digit and print the answer
     *** multiplying a and b
               @ using operator * we multiply a and b


==========> a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, <==========
==========>          followed bya new line                   <==========
## must print from 0 to 9 in new line 
     *** problem one --> how to print from 0 to 9
               @ using forloop (i = 0; i < 10; i++) this will help 
                 itrate the number from 0 by incrementing it  to 9
