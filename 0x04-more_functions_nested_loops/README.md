==========> a function that checks for uppercase character <==========
## must return 1 if it is uppercase and 0 otherwise
     *** problrm one --> how to check it ?
               @ using if and else
 
     *** problem two ---> to what to check it against ?
               @ if char alphabet is greater than "A" 
               @ and less than "Z" print 1 
               @ else print 0


==========> a function that checks for a digit <==========
## must rturn 1 if it is digit and 0 otherwise
     *** the same logic as the above 
               @if it digit print 1 else print 0
