to know if the number is posetive negative or zero we use if else 
In C, you can use the "else if" construct to add multiple conditional branches following an "if" statement. The syntax for the "else if" construct is as follows:
---------- c ------------
if (condition1) {
    // Code block executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // Code block executed if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else if (condition3) {
    // Code block executed if condition1 and condition2 are false and condition3 is true
} else {
    // Code block executed if all previous conditions are false
}
-------------- c -------------
